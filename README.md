# zk Schnitzelhunt

*Some call it treasure hunt, some call it scavenger hunt, in my home country Austria we call it Schnitzeljagd (I half-translated it for your convenience)*

## Treasure Hunt / Scavenger Hunt

> A scavenger hunt is a game in which the organizers prepare a list defining specific items, which the participants seek to gather or complete all items on the list, usually without purchasing them.[1] Usually participants work in small teams, although the rules may allow individuals to participate. The goal is to be the first to complete the list or to complete the most items on that list. In variations of the game, players take photographs of listed items or be challenged to complete the tasks on the list in the most creative manner. A treasure hunt is another name for the game, but it may involve following a series of clues to find objects or a single prize in a particular order.

## How the game works

The game works as follows: A user will be presented a riddle. The riddle will gives a lead to a location in the Vienna city center. To solve the riddle the user will have to find the place in question and share their location at the correct spot. Solving one riddle will unlock the next until at the end, the user will have hunted the Schnitzel.
